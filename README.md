## üìò Abstract

This project explores efficient deployment of deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices, particularly the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It addresses computational, memory, and energy limitations using a full pipeline of optimization techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and TensorRT acceleration. We evaluated this pipeline on architectures like VGG11, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, NASNet, and AlexNet, achieving up to 18√ó speedup with minimal accuracy loss.

## üìå Overview

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in numerous applications. However, their computational demands hinder deployment on low-power devices. This project proposes a complete pipeline integrating:

- Model pruning (structured and unstructured)
- Quantization (post-training & quantization-aware)
- Low-rank approximations (SVD-based)
- Knowledge distillation (KD)
- TensorRT acceleration

These methods are applied to 5 popular architectures (VGG, MobileNet, NASNet, AlexNet, EfficientNet) and tested on Jetson Nano.

In addition to the five CNN architectures, we deployed real-time applications to further evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization and deployment pipeline on the Jetson Nano. These applications include:

- `YOLOv8s` for real-time object detection

- `MobileNet SSD` for lightweight object detection

- Face detection and recognition, using `facedetect` for detection and `InceptionResNetV1` for generating face embeddings

These practical use cases demonstrate the feasibility and performance benefits of running optimized deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices.
